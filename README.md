# Info
This is a recreation of the OG Github created by Sahneisttoll. Sahne was banned for inappropiate behavior and in retailation deleted the github containing the links to all the 3D models. This new version will be operated by multiple people in order to ensure it wont get nuked like the old one that Sahne was the only one running.

Raw contains everything from the [3D Print forum](https://discord.com/channels/512287844258021376/1132040858343059638), but it is unorganized. You'll have a hard time seeing what all is made you can sift through it if you want to, but I recommend waiting for the new pages of everything to be made.

The Tutorials of the OG Github are lost but will be recreated. Once the lists are organized.
