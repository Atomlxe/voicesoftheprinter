# Printer Submissions

Due to an unforseen limitation on Discord you can now submit prints via Email for the archive.
Why this change? Because Discord threads will only allow 1000 people into a thread and we just hit that in the thread for 3D Prints.
This was getting planned on doing anyways for people outside the discord who wanted to submit thier prints for the archive. Not that I have gotten anyone asking this is just incase.

Anyways here is what you need to know for submitting prints.

## Rules

- Packaging
  
 When submitting your print please submit it in a zipped file. The format does not matter rar zip 7zip. Aslong as its like this its easier to upload.

- Size Limiation
  
 The files for the print need to be under 25MBs. This is the limiation set by github for files. You can submit a file into multiple parts if its too big for a single zip and we will just upload it multiple parts that need to be downloaded.

 - Example Image

Please give an example of image of your print when submitting it. Preferably in game showcasing its size.

- Credits

For your submission please give us a name of how you want to be credited. As of this point the credits are discord names, but if you want to use a diffrent name or simply remain Anonmyous. Please say so.

Following these please submit your prints at the following email
